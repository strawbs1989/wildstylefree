  </div>

  <div class="rule mb-4">
    <h4>3. Music & Content</h4>
    <p>Wildstyle Radio holds a broadcasting license that allows us to play both signed (commercial) and unsigned (independent) music. DJs are encouraged to maintain a balanced and diverse playlist, showcasing both popular tracks and emerging talent.</p>
    <p>While our license covers most music, DJs must avoid uploading or distributing music outside of the station without proper rights. Plagiarism or passing off someone elseâ€™s work as your own is strictly prohibited.</p>

  <div class="rule mb-4">
    <h4>6. Scheduling & Communication</h4>
    <p>DJs must stick to their scheduled times and notify management of absences with at least 24 hoursâ€™ notice. Use the official communication channels for updates, scheduling, and emergencies. Failure to communicate repeated absences may result in removal from the schedule.</p>
